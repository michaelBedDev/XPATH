      <p>of the scarcity of money and general distress at Calcutta. The multitude are out of
         employ, and who cannot get into any situations by which they might support
         themselves, is truly deplorable. If a place falls vacant, a croud of necessitous
         candidates immediately urge their distresses, and it is certainly a fact, that, for
         one appointment, there are thirty Englishmen who would be happy to obtain it, so
         many have gone out lately to India, for whom there is no employment.</p>

      <p>October 31. We are informed by very respectable authority, that Mr. M'Gillvry has
         written to the President of the United States, a full and sensible account of the
         rise and progress of the disputes subsisting between the Georgians; from which
         statement he expected to prove, to a demonstration, that he has not acted the
         inconsistent part which some have alleged, neither has there been such cruelties
         committed by the Indians.</p>

      <p>November 12. On Thursday last the Viscount de Ponteves gave a surperb entertainment
         and ball to a number of respectable ladies of gentleman of this town on board
         l'Illustre, of seventy-four guns. The boats of the fleet, the state yacht and barge,
         received the company at Foster's wharf, before 12 o'clock–and on the appearance of
         the first boat having ladies on board, a signal gun was fired from l'Illustre, and
         in an instant the squadron was beautifully arrayed with the flags of all nations.
         On
         arriving at the ship, the company were very politely received by the Viscount, and
         conducted to the state room–the marines saluting as the company passed them. At one
         o'clock the whole sat down to a table liberally spread with a profusion of luxuries
         and delicacies, in a hall erected for the occasion, which was very fancifully
         decorated. At the head of the table was a castle of pastry, having thirteen metal
         guns, by which from tubes that communicated through the table, and the company were
         saluted with a f–deral discharge. On the top of the castle waved a small white
         ensign–the device, two hearts –the motto, " The United hearts of America and
         France." The head of the hall was ornamented with a heart pieced with arrows–and in
         the motton, " Homage to the fair daughters of America," a fine compliment made by
         the noble Viscount to his female guests. After dinner, the ball began, and closed
         before nine o'clock, and on departure, his Excellency was saluted with thirteen
         rockets let off from a boat moored at some distance from the ship.</p>

         so as to enable our countrymen to supply themselves with most articles at a cheaper
         rate than if they were at home ; the credit of the revenue rather upon the increase
         ; Lord Cornwallis is as strict as ever, who is expected to remain another year among
         them, to the no small regret of those who left England for the sake of Oriental
         wealth.</p>

      <p>By letters from the New York Packet, dated October 6, from Philadelphia, we learn
         that there has been a very fine harvest in the Southern States, and that the wheat
         has been wonderfully productive. A very large quantity had been bought up for the
         Spanish markets. The quality of European goods, imported the last season was
         immense, goods selling for considerable loss ; and such will always be the case when
         the Merchants in England anticipate a ray of fruitfulness of the American Soil.–The
         appearance of a Spanish war had given them great prospects of commercial advantages,
         and a seven years war is what the Americans were all earnestly wishing for.</p>

      <p>When the Cherokee Chiefs first visited Coventgarden Theatre, one of them appeared
         much delighted with the splendid appearance of an Indian cap worn by one of the
         pantomime actors; this being observed, the performer was directed the performance;
         the Chief, amazed at the offer of the magnificent present, said, through his
         interpreter, " that even in his won country he should be unable to repay it ;
         however, at present he would do the utmost in his power ;" on this he ordered the
         actor to approach him, and then lighting his Cherokee pipe stuffed with a variety
         of
         nauseous combustibles, he too three whiffs himself, and presenting the tube, desired
         the actor to take three whiffs also–the greatest favour a Cherokee could confer ;
         the actor, aastonished at the singularity of this unexpected honour, reluctantly
         complied with the request,to the great entertainment of the Dramatic circle.</p>

      <p> The Indian ships lately returned from Madras and Bengal, gives unfavourable accounts
         of all the branches of commerce, except that of matrimony, which has succeeded
         wonderfully in the last female exportations. Out of eleven ladies, who embarked on
         a
         marriage venture on board the Chesterfield, Captain Burgess, nine were connubially
         linked to weakly husbands within three months after their arrival and the other two
         were left in a way to complete this fortunate band of hymeneal adventu- rers.</p>

      <p>Advice from Charlestown, South Carolina, says that the Indians in Washington county
         commit the most horrid depredations and cruelties. They have set fire to several
         houses; and a woman, who had a sick husband, telling them from a window, of her
         calamity, they shot her dead on the spot, and then set fire to the spot. The sick
         man was consequently burnt.</p>

      <p> The Indian Chiefs lately arrived in town are six in number. They have been
         indiscriminately styled Cherokees, but three of them only are of that nation, and
         three are Creek Indians.–They are all handsome men, not exceeding in age twenty -
         five or twenty-six. These six Chiefs have 20,000 warriors ready to take the field,
         and have the strongest wish to act in conjunction with the English. They travelled
         3000 miles before the reached Halifax, and were near 12 months in performing the
         journey. From Halifax they went in an English frigate to Quebec to Lord Dorchester,
         by whom they were sent over to England to concert their plans in person with the
         Ministry.</p>

         doubt, when we shall be aided by an army of 20,000 Indian warriors, beside the
         active support of those Mexicans now ??? under the tyranous yoke of Spain.</p>

      <p> The brig Virginia Planter, James Merrifield, Master, arrived at Liverpool, brings
         information that on the 5th of May, General Wayne, with two thousand provincials,
         had attacked totally destroyed most of the Indian towns at the back of Georgia, for
         near two hundred miles around the river. That M'Gilvray, and his army of savages,
         after an unsuccessful and bloody engagement, had fled to the woods, where the
         General left them, and returned to Savannah.– This expedition was undertaken about
         the beginning of March, winch has been crowned with the expected catastrophe, and
         though the Cherokee, Miami, and Chiquesaw tribes, may mediate revenge at some future
         period; it is not likely they will be in a condition to disturb the settlers for
         some years to come.</p>

      <p>Letters from Alexandria, in Virginia, dated the 9th May last, mention, that General
         Wayne had been dispatched, in the beginning of March, on an expedition against the
         Cherokee Miamis and Chickesau Indians, who have, for some time past, had as their
         chief warrior, one Macgillivray, a Scotchman, who has long resided among these
         Indians. General Wayne, at the head of two thousand Provincials, had completely
         routed them after a great slaughter. After the battle, Macgillivray and his savages
         took refuge in the woods. General Wayne has destroyed the most part of the
         habitation of these Indians in the extent of 200 English miles along the river,
         which is the boundary of Georgia, after which he returned to Savannah. This defeat
         is so total, that it will put it out of the power of these Indians to be again
         troublesome to the State of Virginia.</p>

      <p>The American States having now gained their independence, have no cause of quarrel
         let with this country; but matters are very different between them and Spain. It is
         well known, that the Indians on the back settlements have been regularly supplied
         with arms and ammunition from the Spanish magazines in the West-Indies, to enable
         them to distress the Americans, and prove at least a hindrance to their growing
         prosperity.The free navigation of the Mississippi has been denied them?and the
         Spaniards, now in possession of the Floridas, have been continually quarrelling with
         them about their boundaries.</p>

      <p>Extract of a letter from Philadelphia, July 22.</p>
      <p class="colourRED">[397]</p>
      <p>Glasgow</p>
      <p>By an extract of a letter from Jamaica we learn the following singular fact;–The
         Captain and crew of the brig Exuma, which arrived there some days before from
         Newfoundland, having in the course of their passage fallen in with a French
         schooner, Captain Alward asked the Captain of the schooner to accommodate him with
         some nails, which he politely did; at the same time begging his acceptance of some
         barracoutes caught that morning. Captain Aylward and his crew having dined off them
         the same day, they were immediately seized with violent sickness convulsive fits,
         and other dangerous symptoms. The Captain, judging that the fish they had eaten were
         of a poisonous nature, conceived that salt water might be of service, he instantly
         made the expedient on himself, which relieved him greatly ; he applied the same
         remedy to his crew and it was attended with good effects. When this unfortunate
         accident happened, it was luckily a dead calm ; had the weather been tempestous, it
         is more than probable the ship and crew would have been lost, as during their
         sickness, there was not a man able to stand by the helm.</p>
      <p class="colourRED">[398]</p>
      <p>Glasgow</p>
      <p>By letters received from Norfolk in Virginia, dated the 23rd of July, we learn that
         on the 10th of that month the ship Betsey of Greenock, Capt. James Young, had
         arrived there in 19 days from Jamaica, and brought the following melancholy relation
         which he received from the crew of the Prudence, whom she picked up on the 1st of
         Juin lat. 22. 40. long. 85. 32. That from the 7th to the 10th of June the weather
         had been very hazy, with little wind, so that Capt Addies could not get an
         observation, and a strong current setting to the Southward and Westward, drove them
         farther leeward than they imagined. On the 12th, about 3 o'clock in the morning, the
         watch discovered Cape Catuloh, but before intelligence could be given to the
         Captain, she struck. For some time she made no water but about seven the water came
         in so fast, that by eleven o'clock, A. M. the water was six feet in the hold (the
         depth of the water in which she lay,) the people being sixteen in number, took to
         their long boat, and endeavoured to make Cape Antonie; but after four days fruitless
         labour they were obliged to return to the wreck, where they found two Spaniards
         plundering, who informed them that there were only four inhabitants on the island,
         and therefore they could receive no assistance from them; upon which, having taken
         a
         quantity of beef and biscuits aboard, they left the wreck a second time, and after
         having been absent fourteen days, were providentially picked up by the ship Betsey,
         and carried to Norfolk in Virginia.</p>

      <p>" A singular revolution has taken place at Martinique. The Governor, Viscount Damas,
         with the troops, had taken possession of St. Pierre's; having established peace, as
         they concluded, they retired to Fort Bourbon; the patriots again at ??ed, have
         suprised and taken the fort. The governor has escaped with a company of grenadiers,
         and it is reported he is since joined by about five hundred people of colour."</p>

         or three particular instances have large sums been given–the bounty is generally
         from 5 to 6 guineas.</p>
